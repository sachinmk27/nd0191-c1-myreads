# MyReads Project

In the MyReads project, you'll be able to create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. You can also search for books to add your bookshelf.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
